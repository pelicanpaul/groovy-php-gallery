groovy-php-gallery
==================

File-Based Image Galleries with php, ftp, Shadowbox and a Groovy File Structure. 
1/5/2015 I have added some image thumb creation when the assets directory for a gallery is first accessed. This creates a thumbs directory and automates thumbnails for faster page loads.

You can see a working version at http://www.pelicancafe.net/development/gallery/
