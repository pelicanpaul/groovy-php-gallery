==================

File-Based Image Galleries with php, ftp, Shadowbox and a Groovy File Structure.

I have added some image thumb creation when the assets directory for a gallery is first accessed. This creates a thumbs directory and automates thumbnails for faster page loads.

Integrated Bootstrap 3 so that the gallery is mobile-friendly. Checked for non-images.
